The traditional Tikkun Korim places the 'Chumash' text on the right and the 'Torah' text on the left. This project was made with mobile one-handed usage on small-screened devices in mind. We came up with a simple way to get the most out of the small screen, by simply tapping to remove the Trop and Nikkud.

**תיקון קוראים לחמשה חומשי תורה**

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

* Select a Chumash then a Parsha then an Aliya.
* Tap the text to switch from with Nikkud and Trop/Taamim/Simanim to without. And vice versa.
* Tap the back button on the top of the screen to go to the previous menu.
* Tap the grid (four squares) to start from the beginning.
* Quickly switch from one Aliya to the next by tapping the arrows on the top left.
